ðŸ©º Disease Predictor

A machine learning-based Disease Prediction System that predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on user-provided health parameters. This project leverages Python, scikit-learn, and Colab Notebook to build, train, and evaluate prediction models.

ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Predicts diseases based on Kaggle UCI Heart Disease Data

âœ… Uses supervised machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)

âœ… Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection

âœ… Model training, evaluation, and comparison

âœ… Interactive predictions with test input samples

âœ… Well-structured Colab Notebook for easy understanding
