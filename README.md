🩺 Disease Predictor

A machine learning-based Disease Prediction System that predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on user-provided health parameters. This project leverages Python, scikit-learn, and Colab Notebook to build, train, and evaluate prediction models.

📌 Features

✅ Predicts diseases based on Kaggle UCI Heart Disease Data

✅ Uses supervised machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)

✅ Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection

✅ Model training, evaluation, and comparison

✅ Interactive predictions with test input samples

✅ Well-structured Colab Notebook for easy understanding
